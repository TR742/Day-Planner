-About The Project-

Day Planner Screenshot (./Day Planner.png)

For this assignment, we were given starter code to help create a day planner. This day planner should change styles based on the time of day and should be able to save information.

-Creation Process-

1) Updated HTMl with div's containing the CSS starter code classes and id's to help form the page layout
2) Used moment.js to add the time under the header

!!Work still in progress!!
